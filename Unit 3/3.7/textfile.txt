Computer science is a vast and fascinating field of study.
I started to learn how to program in 1983 (at the ripe old age of 11) and most of my earliest programs were simple games and animations.
Learning to program doesn't have to be boring!
Game programming provides all the same challenges as other kinds of programming, but games are also visual and interactive which I think helps to motivate students new to the field.

Learning to program games is even more fun than playing them because you can design and create your own world.
But even though games are fun, they are also a serious business; in fact game development is a multi-billion dollar industry employing thousands of computer science graduates.  
To become a game developer requires a solid foundation in the principles of computer science and a zest for life-long learning.

Programming is a marvellous, vital, and intellectually stimulating activity.
After 27 years I still get a kick out of learning new programming languages, and even more satisfaction sharing what I know with others.   
It is my sincere wish that this course mark the beginning of a life-long interest in computing for you as well.
Let's get started!
